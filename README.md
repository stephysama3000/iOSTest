# iOSTest

The app is actually running on Xcode 13.2.1 with Swift 5 and a deployment target 15.2.
First you must double click on MobileTest.xcworkspace. The project is using cocoapods, so you must have installed it.
Open terminal, go to the file's location and write pod install.
Once it is done, just play the project and you will see what i've done on it.

As third-party libraries i used:
- Alamofire : it is a well-knowned library for making API Calls that simplifies the networking tasks.

Talking about the architecture, i used MVVM. It is greatly use for coding reuse, maintain a clean code and a clear visualization of models and views.
